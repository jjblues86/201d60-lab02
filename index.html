            <p>My name is Jerome Joof and i'm originally from The Gambia, West. I moved to the U.S 9 years ago to pursue a degree in Computer Science and better opportunities. I am Highly dependable and a curious thinker. Great problem solver by harnessing my technological skills set as a Software Engineer. I have experiences which range from across different industries such as Insurance, Customer Service, Real Estate and Finance.
    
            The burning desire to impact other peopleâ€™s lives is what keeps me going. I am a great team player who values hard work, accountability and constant improvement.
            
            As a Software Engineer I wholeheartedly believe that I will add immense value to the work process.
            My past experiences have enabled me to always consider the user of the product/software I build.
            
            Therefore, the user experience is of greater importance to me. Constant improvement in the workflow and holding myself to a high standard demonstrated in my ability to deliver well tested applications.
